A social media app where users can open an account and share posts with friends. You can follow and get followed by others, see their posts, like them and get friend suggestions.  

Itâ€™s a full-stack specifically MERN web app inspired by Instagram.

The features I mostly tried to focus on include authentication, authorization, setting up optimized RESTful API, and fetching data from the client.  

*This app is on its first milestone and features like comments, video, live chat and etc will be applied in the near future.*
